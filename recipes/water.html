        <p>Ubiquitous throughout the universe as two parts hydrogen(H), one part oxygen(O), water(H₂O) is the be-all-end-all beverage for all your parched needs. It boasts a boiling point of 100 °C (212 °F), and a melting point of 0 °C (32 °F). There is the same amount of water on Earth as there was when the Earth was formed. The water <em>you</em> drink from your faucet could contain molecules that dinosaurs drank (<strong>Gross!</strong>). Nearly 97% of the world's water is salty and otherwise undrinkable. Another 2% is locked in ice caps and glaciers. That leaves just 1% for the rats, their agriculture, residential warrens, manufacturing plants, communities, and personal needs(<a href="https://www3.epa.gov/safewater/kids/waterfactsoflife.html">Source</a>).</p>
        <p><strong>Today</strong>, we learn how to drink that 1%...like a philosopher.</p>

        <h3>Rough Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><h4>Well/Reservoir/Faucet/etc.</h4></li>
            <p>Because the water has to come from somewhere, id est, the source.</p>
            <li><h4>Ladle/Bucket</h4></li>
            <p>For retrieving the water from the well.</p>
            <li><h4>Cup/Goblet/Mug/Empty Soda Bottle</h4></li>
            <p>The more pretentious your receptacle of choice, the more you <a href="https://www.everydayhealth.com/self-care/">honor yourself</a>.</p>
            <li><h4>Mouth</h4></li>
            <p>The linchpin of the entire process.</p>
            <li><h4>Thirst</h4></li>
            <p>The mind knows what the body wants. The mind quantifies needs through concepts. The mind influences the world through its body by direction of its needs. The mind is thirsty.</p>
        </ul>
