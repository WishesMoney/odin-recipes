        <b>A rare and hilarious nihilistic delecacy. As the tale goes, a rat once happened on a village, hungry from her long journey. The village, rife with plenty, offered nothing to the vermin who had no currancy to pay. But a rat is a rat is a rat, and so she schemed to manufacture something from nothing.</b>
        <b>At the towns center she placed a large pot. The townfolk watched from their shops and homes as she filled the pot with water and set a fire beneath.</b>
        <b>"Mama, what does the rat make?" Asked the children.</b>
        <b>But none knew, and their fascination grew as she heaved a large stone into the simmering water.</b>
        <b>"Ho, there, rat!" Called a young man. "What do you do here?"</b>
        <b>"I'm cooking," said the rat. Her thin smile wrapped to her eyes.</b>
        <b>"Cooking? I see no ingredients," replied the young man. His head swivvled to the rat's travelling satchel. "What are you cooking?"</b>
        <b>"Stone Soup!" Squeaked the rat. "A delightful dish. You'll love it, and you're more than welcome to have some."</b>
        <b>"That's very generous of you."</b>
        <b>"Yes. Yes, it is. And good old fashioned Stone Soup tastes best with a little beef. Do you have any?"</b>
        <b>The young man's brow tightened. "Yes," he said. "I can spare some for the sake of this strange rat-soup."</b>
        <b>So the young man fetched the beef and into the soup it splashed. Before long, other towns folk gathered around the rat's cooking pot. They were all curious, and eager to taste this strange soup. So one by one spared garnishment and flavor to the pot until a soup of soups was born.</b>
